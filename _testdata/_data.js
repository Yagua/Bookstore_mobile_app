        description: "Oh I Do Like to Be Beside the Seaside - Christopher Fowler Christopher Fowler explains \"'. . . Seaside' came about firstly because I was commissioned to write a story for the World Horror Convention souvenir book and, as the event was to take place in Brighton, it seemed logical to set a tale on the South coast of England. \"I had written a fantasy novel, Calabash, some years earlier, hinting at the dark madness of such seaside towns, which are the antithesis of their Mediterranean counterparts. I thought of the depressing Morrissey song \"Every Day is Like Sunday\", which captures the awfulness of English resorts. \"Coincidentally, Kim Newman and I were discussing the inherent creepiness of pantomime dames, and I decided it was time to give vent to my horror of these coastal pleasure domes. I wish I'd thought to include screaming gangs of hen-nighters as well. And I thought it was a nice touch to have everyone in the story telling the hero to 'fuck off' until he finally does.\" Featherweight - Robert Shearman \"I don't like writing at home much,\" admits the author. \"Home is a place for sleeping and eating and watching afternoon game shows on TV. There are too many distractions. So, years ago, I decided I'd only write first drafts in art galleries. \"And the best of them all is the National Gallery, in London, a pigeon's throw from Nelson's Column. I can walk around there with my notebook, thinking up stories - and if I get bored, there are lots of expensive pictures to look at. Perfect. \"A lot of those paintings, however, have angels in them. They're all over the place, wings raised, halos gleaming - perching on clouds, blowing trumpets, hovering around the Virgin Mary as if they're her strange naked childlike bodyguards. And I began to notice. That, whenever the writing is going well, the angels seemed happy, and would smile at me. And whenever the words weren't coming out right, when I felt sluggish, when I thought I'd rather take off and get myself a beer, they'd start to glare. \"I wrote this story in the National Gallery. Accompanied by a lot of glaring angels. Enjoy.\" Lesser Demons - Norman Partridge \"I was surprised to receive an invitation for S.T. Joshi's Black Wings,\" reveals Partridge, \"an anthology of Lovecraftian fiction. Although I knew S.T. admired my work, I've never quite seen myself as a Mythos writer. \"While I respect H.P. Lovecraft and his contribution to horror, I've never felt that his worldview (or maybe I should say universeview) meshed with mine. \"In the end, that's what made the story work . . . at least for me. I concentrated on my differences with Lovecraft, and approached the material from a place where Jim Thompson would be more comfortable than HPL. And I'm delighted that so many people have enjoyed the tale - it was a lot of fun to write.\"",

        description: "Looking for your newest binge read? Grab these 3 full-length romantic suspense books and ignite your love for Steele Ridge's favorite foodies--The Kingstons. Take this family adventure and discover intrigue, heroism, and--most of all\u2014epic love. Craving HEAT by Adrienne Giordano - Maggie Kingston is a woman working in a man\u2019s world\u2026and doing a damn good job. Being Steele Ridge\u2019s first female sheriff isn\u2019t easy. Especially when your cousins are magnets for trouble. The Steeles do everything the hard way, but Maggie\u2019s tougher than she looks. Nothing shakes this sheriff until her cousin brings one of his superstar players\u2014and the accompanying media circus\u2014to town. The press can\u2019t get enough of the sexy quarterback. And neither can Maggie\u2026 Jayson Tucker devoted his whole career to the New York Knights. So when the team takes a rookie\u2019s side over his after a locker room brawl, he takes refuge from the spotlight. Except reporters aren\u2019t the only ones after him. Someone wants Jayson benched. Permanently. When the threat becomes deadly, hiding won\u2019t be enough. And in Steele Ridge, security comes in the luscious form of its gorgeous, no-nonsense sheriff. Jayson\u2019s always fought his own battles. The closer he gets to Maggie, the less he\u2019s willing to risk her being caught in the crossfire. Yet Maggie is no damsel in distress. She\u2019s more than capable of keeping her town\u2014and her man\u2014safe. But can she say the same about her heart? Tasting FIRE by Kelsey Browning - Fire in one hand, ashes in the other Studious tutor Emmy McKay fell in love with Cash Kingston over a biology textbook, never expecting the high school football hero to give her a second thought. But his feelings for her burned just as hot. All too soon, Emmy\u2019s choices destroyed their youthful relationship, reducing it to a pile of ash. Years later, she has landed her dream job as an ER doctor in her hometown. Now it\u2019s time to win back her dream man. As a firefighter and tactical medic, Cash Kingston is no stranger to white-knuckle situations. But when he learns his beautiful\u2014and brilliant\u2014ex-girlfriend has returned to Steele Ridge, he feels as if he\u2019s standing on the roof of a blazing building. With no escape route in sight. Emmy is the only woman who\u2019s ever had the power to build him up one minute and burn him down the next. But when someone targets Emmy and they begin to suspect the danger stems from their past relationship, it\u2019s impossible for Cash to stay detached. Will the struggle to untangle a web of half-truths bring them closer together, or will it tear them apart for good? Searing NEED by Tracey Devlyn - To escape a brutal killer, a brilliant researcher teams up with a tortured soldier who poses an even greater threat... to her heart. Her sister might be the law and her brothers the brawn, but Riley Kingston is definitely the brains of the family. She\u2019s a talented botanist well on her way to a PhD\u2014so why does she feel like a failure? Fired from a dream project in Costa Rica, Riley\u2019s stuck back in her hometown. Cataloguing plants on Steele land keeps her busy, but it\u2019s far from compelling work. Until she discovers a fascinating new specimen. One with a body made for pleasure . . . and eyes filled with a pain she longs to understand. Delta Force operator Coen Monroe doesn\u2019t want to be studied. Not even by the sexy scientist whose inquisitive glances stir up desires he isn\u2019t ready to handle. He came to Steele Ridge to be alone, to battle his nightmares and the memories triggering them. But Riley\u2019s gentle seduction is as relentless as her curiosity. She soothes his wounded soul . . . and fires up his defensive instincts. But when her research sparks a deadly conspiracy, Coen is exactly what she needs. When Riley is targeted by a sociopath bent on silencing her forever, Coen will do anything to protect her. But can he save the woman he loves without losing himself in the process? Although all books are stand alones, if you would like to read the entire Steele Ridge series chronologically, the following is the correct order: The Beginning - The Steeles Going Hard - The Steeles Living Fast - The Steeles Loving Deep - The Steeles Breaking Free - The Steeles Roaming Wild - The Steeles Stripping Bare - The Steeles Enduring Love - The Steeles Craving Heat - The Kingstons Tasting Fire - The Kingstons Searing Need - The Kingstons Vowing Love - The Steeles Striking Edge - The Kingstons Burning Ache - The Kingstons",

Maupin deftly illustrates how far America and the pioneering Anna have come, and nearly forty years into the series, his writing remains wildly addictive but is deeper and richer.\u201d\u2014People The last three novels of Armistead Maupin\u2019s bestselling, critically-acclaimed Tales of the City are now available for the first time as an omnibus edition. The epic series, published between 1978 and 2014, spans the decade before the AIDS crisis through the era of marriage equality following an unforgettable set of characters, whose diverse sexual identities helped set the social stage for the ongoing sexual revolution.

Joining two companion omnibus volumes, 28 Barbary Lane and Back to Barbary Lane, Goodbye Barbary Lane presents all of \u201cMr. Maupin\u2019s adeptness at fluid dialogue, his flair for shaping characters who thread the needle between pop archetypes and singular human beings, and his great gift for intricate if occasionally preposterous plotting\u201d(New York Times).",

        description: "When Rylie went to summer camp, she didn\u2019t expect to get bitten by a werewolf and turn into a monster. She also didn\u2019t expect to fall in love\u2014especially not with a werewolf hunter. Between ravenous werewolf packs, a bloodthirsty family of hunters, and Rylie\u2019s battle with her inner wolf, all the odds are stacked against Rylie\u2019s love for Seth. But Seth will do anything to be with her\u2026even if it means turning against his family and sacrificing everything. This is a collection of the first four books in the Seasons of the Moon series. It contains: Six Moon SummerAll Hallows' MoonLong Night MoonGray Moon RisingSIX MOON SUMMERRylie's been bitten. She's changing. And now she has three months to find a cure before becoming a werewolf... forever. Rylie Gresham hates everything about summer camp: the food, the fresh air, the dumb activities, and the other girls in her cabin. But the worst part is probably being bitten by a werewolf. Being a teenager is hard enough, but now she's craving raw flesh and struggles with uncontrollable anger. If she doesn't figure out a way to stop the transformation, then at the end of summer, her life is worse than over. She'll be a monster. ALL HALLOWS' MOONThe good girl has become the big bad wolf... Rylie survived a werewolf bite. She's moved to her aunt's ranch to enroll in a new school and continue her life--except now she transforms into a monster every moon and struggles to control her murderous urges. Without many werewolves left, it's hard to stay in hiding. A family of hunters--Eleanor, Abel, and Seth--recognize the signs and follow Rylie to her new home. They want to stop her before she murders someone, and the only way to do it is with a silver bullet. Seth soon realizes the werewolf is Rylie, the one monster he failed to kill. Worse yet, he's still in love with her. Torn between family and love, Rylie struggles to reconcile her feelings and control the wolf within while Seth fights to do what's right. But what is right--obeying desire or duty? LONG NIGHT MOONSomething is killing innocent people around Rylie Gresham's town. The police think it's a wild animal, but she has other suspicions. There are new kids at school, and they have a lot in common with her: gold eyes, super strength, and a habit of turning furry. It seems Rylie's not the only werewolf around anymore. It's up to Rylie and her werewolf-hunting boyfriend, Seth, to stop the killings. But saving lives doesn't come naturally to a monster, and territory battles could risk the life of her sickly aunt--not to mention her own. Rylie has no choice but to stand her ground, protect her home, and stop the murders before anyone else gets hurt. GRAY MOON RISINGIt's been almost a year since Rylie Gresham was bitten by a werewolf on Gray Mountain. Now something is beckoning her back to the place she was attacked, along with every other werewolf in the world. But they aren't the only ones heeding the call. A group of hunters notices them gathering and sees it as their chance to wipe out the entire species. Seth is about to graduate high school when he learns of the final hunt. He secretly plans to save Rylie and his werewolf brother even though he has to play along with the hunters to do it. But Rylie doesn't want to be saved. She's already decided to solve her problems with a silver bullet if answers aren't waiting on Gray Mountain. One way or another, everything is about to end--whether it means Rylie's liberation or the end of her life... dark urban fantasy, occult supernatural, free fantasy book, bargain fantasy book, urban dark fantasy, paranormal romance, werewolves, werewolf pack, free, freebie, young adult paranormal keywords: urban fantasy, paranormal romance, urban fantasy romance, werewolf romance, shapeshifter romance, angels, demons, science fiction romance, free urban fantasy novel, free books, free paranormal, exorcist, urban fantasy series",

Meet Father Tom Greer and Detective Helen Parr, former lovers reunited after twenty years, as they solve crimes old and new--and explore the profound mysteries of the human heart. The Buried Bride (Book 4)--With the Archbishop\u2019s blessing, Helen and I are spending Lent building a relationship built on love--but without physical intimacy. And yes, it\u2019s as hard as it sounds. But this penitential season, I have other work to do. I need to rebuild my relationship with the families of St. Clare\u2019s after neglecting my duties as their shepherd. I must confess my sins to them, and ask their forgiveness. With these two tasks, I expected this Lent to be the longest of my life. But I didn\u2019t expect to be fighting to stay out of prison. The Defining Decision (Book 5)--After the astonishing news from the Archbishop, Helen and I are looking forward to possibly having a life together as husband and wife. That is, if the Holy Father grants me permission. While awaiting word from the Vatican, we\u2019re getting to know each other more deeply. Going out on dates, spending time together, talking about what our life together will be like if we\u2019re allowed to marry. All of this under Anna\u2019s watchful eye, and being very careful to keep things secret. But then Gladys runs over the President of Myer College\u2019s chief of staff. What looks like a tragic accident takes a bizarre turn when drugs are found in his system. Is the young genius I consider a daughter guilty of murder, or is she being set up by someone from her past? The Silent Shooter (Book 6)--The Pope\u2019s decision to allow us to marry captures the imagination of the entire world. Finally, after having to hide our relationship from all but a few close friends, we can openly proclaim our love for each other, and celebrate with our parish family our future lives together. But not everyone, it seems, is happy with our plans. First come the letters, threatening Helen with divine justice if she persists in her plans. Then, on live television, someone takes a shot at us. It soon becomes apparent that someone\u2019s decided to stop us at any cost. But Helen already knows who wants her dead. It\u2019s someone from her past as a Detective in Washington, D.C. A serial killer who sees himself acting as God\u2019s instrument to kill impure women. With little to go on besides the letters of a lunatic and a possible connection between the killer and a fanatic priest with his own agenda, we\u2019re in a race against time to find a killer--before the killer finds us first.

        title: "Bottlenecks",
        description: "Learn the psychological constrictions of attention, perception, memory, disposition, motivation, and social influence that determine whether customers will be receptive to your digital innovations. Bottlenecks: Aligning UX Design with User Psychology fills a need for entrepreneurs, designers, and marketing professionals in the application of foundational psychology to user-experience design. The first generation of books on the topic focused on web pages and cognitive psychology. This book covers apps, social media, in-car infotainment, and multiplayer video games, and it explores the crucial roles played by behaviorism, development, personality, and social psychology. Author David Evans is an experimental psychology Ph.D. and senior manager of consumer research at Microsoft who recounts high-stakes case studies in which behavioral theory aligned digital designs with the bottlenecks in human nature to the benefit of users and businesses alike. Innova tors in design and students of psychology will learn: The psychological processes determining users\u2019 perception of, engagement with, and recommendation of digital innovations Examples of interfaces before and after simple psychological alignments that vastly enhanced their effectiveness Strategies for marketing and product development in an age of social media and behavioral targeting Hypotheses for research that both academics and enterprises can perform to better meet users\u2019 needs Who This Book Is For Designers and entrepreneurs will use this book to give their innovations an edge on what are increasingly competitive platforms such as apps, bots, in-car apps, augmented reality content. Usability researchers and market researchers will leverage it to enhance their consulting and reporting. Students and lecturers in psychology departments will want it to help land employment in the private sector. Praise \u201cBottlenecks\u2019 is a tight and eminently actionable read for business leaders in startups and enterprises alike. Evans gives us a rich sense of key psychological processes and even richer examples of them in action.\u201d - Nir Eyal, Author of Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products \u201cClients frequently ask our UX researchers and designers for deeper truths about why certain designs work and others fail. Bottlenecks offers practical explanations and evidence based on the idea that human cognition did not begin with the digital age.\u201d - John Dirks, UX Director and Partner, Blink UX \u201cBottlenecks brings together two very important aspects of user experience design: understanding users and translating this into business impact. A must-read for anyone who wants to learn both.\u201d - Josh Lamar, Sr. UX Lead, Microsoft Outlook",

Compared to other books on this topic, it gives more than just an introduction and develops the readers understanding through frameworks and models, based on research to make it easier to develop gamified systems. The concept of gamification achieved increased popularity in 2010 when a number of softwares and services started explaining their products as a \u2018gamification\u2019 design. Gamification Mindset explains how game elements and mechanics are important, how video games are learning systems and examines how video game aesthetics are vital in the development of gamification. The book will challenge some common beliefs when it comes to gamifications\u2019 abilities to immerse and change the user\u2019s intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. Gamification Mindset aims to develop new models in gamification to enable easier gamification scenarios. It is a comprehensive analysis and discussion about gamification and serves as a useful tool, since it acquaints readers with gamification and how to use it, through illustrated practical theoretical models. Academic researchers, students, educators and professional game and gamification designers will find this book invaluable.",

        description: "Sudoku Programming with C teaches you how to write computer programs to solve and generate Sudoku puzzles. This is a practical book that will provide you with everything you need to write your own books of Sudoku Classic and Samurai puzzles. But be warned: after reading it, you'll discover that the puzzles in your local paper are not so challenging after all! We like Sudokus because they test our capacity to recognize and interpret patterns. But how are the clues generated? Where do those quasi-symmetrical configurations come from? When the author explored the Web to find out, he discovered that there were many sites that explained how to solve Sudokus, but none that told him how create them. He also saw many sites and apps to play Sudoku, but, perhaps not surprising, no indication of how they worked. So, he had to develop his own applications in order to find out. And, from the very start, he decided that he would publish the code for anyone else to use and perhaps tinker with, but the author wrote it in such a way that also lets readers with limited knowledge of programming techniques understand it. In fact, you could decide to start generating thousands of puzzles almost immediately, and go through the explanations of algorithms and techniques later, a bit at a time. The author chose to write the application in \u2018plain old C\u2019 because he wanted to make the code accessible to as many people as possible. In this book, you will find an explanation of all solving strategies, and the code to implement them. Writing the Solver application was more difficult than writing the Generator, because it required designing and implementing each strategy separately. However, the author wanted to include a solving program capable of listing the strategies necessary to solve any particular puzzle. He also wanted to check whether a puzzle was solvable analytically, without any guessing. This book includes the full listings of both the Generator and the Solver, and explanations of all C modules, with walk-throughs and examples.",

        description: "Gain an in-depth knowledge in immersive web development to create augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications inside web browsers using WebXR API, WebGL, Three.js, and A-Frame. This project-based book will provide the practice and portfolio content to make the most of what the futures of spatial computing and immersive technology have to offer. Beginning with technical analysis of how web browsers function, the book covers programming languages such as WebGL, JavaScript, and HTML, with an eye on a complete understanding of the WebXR lifecycle. You'll then explore how contemporary web browsers work at the code level and see how to set up a local development server and use it with the Visual Studio Code IDE to create 3D animation in the WebGL programming language. With a familiarity of the web-rendering pipeline in place, you\u2019ll venture on to WebGL abstractions such as the Three.js JavaScript library and Mozilla\u2019s A-Frame XR Framework, which use WebXR to create high-end visual effects. In the final projects of the book, you\u2019ll create an augmented reality web session for an Android phone device, and create a VR scene in A-Frame (built on Three.js) to demo essential components of the WebXR API pertaining to user positioning and interaction.

You will learn the 3D pipeline using Maya and Substance Painter, which are industry-standard programs used for content creation in game development. You also will know how to add them and work with them in Unity. The book begins with an overall look at the production of game development and the different roles in creating assets. Then, starting with Maya, you learn how to start with a concept and take it through the entire production pipeline: base mesh, UV mapping, high poly, texturing, rigging, and animation. You will be working on one asset project throughout the entire book to understand how one phase leads to the next one. Lastly, you will cover asset placement and integration into Unity. What You Will Learn Build a thorough knowledge of the 3D game asset production workflow Understand how each phase leads up to the next one Know how 3D assets are implemented into Unity Texture, rig, and animate the 3D model Export and import the 3D asset or model Understand the iterative design process Who This Book Is For 3D artists, from beginners to specialists, who are interested in learning the 3D production pipeline of game assets as a whole",

It is a compilation of original work by al-Nayrizi and of translations and commentaries made by others, such as Heron. It is the most influential Arabic mathematical manuscript in existence and a principle vehicle whereby mathematics was reborn in the Latin West. Furthermore, the Commentary on Euclid by the Platonic philosopher Simplicius, entirely reproduced by al-Nayrizi, and nowhere else extant, is essential to the study of the attempt to prove Euclid s Fifth Postulate from the preceding four. Al-Nayrizi was one of the two main sources from which Albertus Magnus (1193-1280), the Doctor Universalis, learned mathematics. This work presents an annotated English translation of Books II-IV and of a hitherto lost portion of Book I.",

The work is based on the Greek text, as it is given in the Editions of August and Peyrard. To the suggestions of the late Professor De Morgan, published in the Companion to the British Almanack for 1849, I have paid constant deference. A limited use of symbolic representation, wherein the symbols stand for words and not for operations, is generally regarded as desirable, and it is certain that the symbols employed in this book are admissible in the Examinations at Oxford and Cambridge. I have generally followed Euclid's method of proof, but not to the exclusion of other methods recommended by their simplicity, such as the demonstrations by which I propose to replace the difficult Theorems 5 and 7 in the First Book.

This perhaps may, in a great measure, be imputed to the scarcity of tracts, giving the necessary preparatory knowledge. Your plan of annexing to the most useful, important, and generally read parts of Euclid's Elements, a well compressed system of Conick Sections, seems well calculated to diffuse that preparatory knowledge, and to connect the Euclidean with the higher geometry. - From the prospectus, and specimens of your work I have seen, and from my confidence in your acknowledged mathematical information and talents, I have no doubt but your publication will answer this valuable purpose, be a useful acquisition both to preceptors and students in mathematicks, and receive from the publick a liberal patronage. Dear Sir. - I have frequently regretted, that, of the many works on the Conick Sections, we have not any, which I deem sufficiently simple and concise for the present state of education in our American corteges. Most of the modern writers on this subject, instead of treating of the three different kinds of curves jointly, have done it separately, thereby rendering their works exceedingly prolix and tedious I highly approve of your system, because it presents, concisely, and at one view, the corresponding properties of the different sections, and possesses all the purity of the synthetick method of the ancients. Your combining with them, elements of Plain and Spherical Trigonometry, with the mathematical principles of Astronomy, will, I have no doubt, tend very much to diffuse mathematical science. I purpose to make use of your work, as a text book, in teaching the Mathematicks, and to recommend it to my friends and former pupils, who arc professors and principals of literary institutions in the southern states.

It is the only English translation of these books other than Heath's out-of-print version which is a modernized retelling rather than a true translation. This 3rd Century BCE work displays astonishing virtuosity in the treatment of conic sections in the classical synthetic geometrical manner. It is the culmination of Greek geometry and, in turn, provided a basis for the work of modern mathematicians and scientists such as Vieta, Descartes, Kepler, and Newton. Includes many corrections to the old edition's text, translation, and notes, all new diagrams, an index, a bibliography, and an introductory essay by Harvey Flaumenhaft. Design and layout make it easy to read and work with, with diagrams repeated on every spread, adequate space for notes, and high quality paper to prevent show-through.",

The next two chapters focus on applications in nuclear engineering, which are illustrative of uses in other fields. Five appendices are included, which provide useful information on probability distributions, general-purpose Monte Carlo codes for radiation transport, and other matters. The famous \"Buffon\u2019s needle problem\" provides a unifying theme as it is repeatedly used to illustrate many features of Monte Carlo methods. This book provides the basic detail necessary to learn how to apply Monte Carlo methods and thus should be useful as a text book for undergraduate or graduate courses in numerical methods. It is written so that interested readers with only an understanding of calculus and differential equations can learn Monte Carlo on their own. Coverage of topics such as variance reduction, pseudo-random number generation, Markov chain Monte Carlo, inverse Monte Carlo, and linear operator equations will make the book useful even to experienced Monte Carlo practitioners. Provides a concise treatment of generic Monte Carlo methods Proofs for each chapter Appendixes include Certain mathematical functions; Bose Einstein functions, Fermi Dirac functions, Watson functions",

        title: "Discrete Cosine and Sine Transforms",
        description: "The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) is used in many applications by the scientific, engineering and research communities and in data compression in particular. Fast algorithms and applications of the DCT Type II (DCT-II) have become the heart of many established international image/video coding standards. Since then other forms of the DCT and Discrete Sine Transform (DST) have been investigated in detail. This new edition presents the complete set of DCT and DST discrete trigonometric transforms, including their definitions, general mathematical properties, and relations to the optimal Karhunen-Lo\u00e9ve transform (KLT), with the emphasis on fast algorithms (one-dimensional and two-dimensional) and integer approximations of DCTs and DSTs for their efficient implementations in the integer domain. DCTs and DSTs are real-valued transforms that map integer-valued signals to floating-point coefficients. To eliminate the floating-point operations, various methods of integer approximations have been proposed to construct and flexibly generate a family of integer DCT and DST transforms with arbitrary accuracy and performance. The integer DCTs/DSTs with low-cost and low-powered implementation can replace the corresponding real-valued transforms in wireless and satellite communication systems as well as portable computing applications. The book is essentially a detailed excursion on orthogonal/orthonormal DCT and DST matrices, their matrix factorizations and integer aproximations. It is hoped that the book will serve as a valuable reference for industry, academia and research institutes in developing integer DCTs and DSTs as well as an inspiration source for further advanced research. Presentation of the complete set of DCTs and DSTs in context of entire class of discrete unitary sinusoidal transforms: the origin, definitions, general mathematical properties, mutual relationships and relations to the optimal Karhunen-Lo\u00e9ve transform (KLT) Unified treatment with the fast implementations of DCTs and DSTs: the fast rotation-based algorithms derived in the form of recursive sparse matrix factorizations of a transform matrix including one- and two-dimensional cases Detailed presentation of various methods and design approaches to integer approximation of DCTs and DSTs utilizing the basic concepts of linear algebra, matrix theory and matrix computations leading to their efficient multiplierless real-time implementations, or in general reversible integer-to-integer implementations Comprehensive list of additional references reflecting recent/latest developments in the efficient implementations of DCTs and DSTs mainly one-, two-, three- and multi-dimensional fast DCT/DST algorithms including the recent active research topics for the time period from 1990 up to now",

        title: "Topics in Structural Graph Theory",
        description: "The rapidly expanding area of structural graph theory uses ideas of connectivity to explore various aspects of graph theory and vice versa. It has links with other areas of mathematics, such as design theory and is increasingly used in such areas as computer networks where connectivity algorithms are an important feature. Although other books cover parts of this material, none has a similarly wide scope. Ortrud R. Oellermann (Winnipeg), internationally recognised for her substantial contributions to structural graph theory, acted as academic consultant for this volume, helping shape its coverage of key topics. The result is a collection of thirteen expository chapters, each written by acknowledged experts. These contributions have been carefully edited to enhance readability and to standardise the chapter structure, terminology and notation throughout. An introductory chapter details the background material in graph theory and network flows and each chapter concludes with an extensive list of references.",

It's 1972 and times are changing. In the small farming community of Mason, Kansas, Vera and Kelly Exton are known for their ambitions. Vera is an activist who wants to join her boyfriend in the Peace Corps. But she is doing her duty caring for her widowed mother and younger sister until Kelly is firmly established. Kelly is studying to become a veterinarian. She plans to marry her childhood sweetheart and eventually take over his father's veterinary practice. But it's a tumultuous time and neither sister is entirely happy with the path that's been laid out for her. As each evaluates her options, everything shifts. Do you do what's right for yourself or what others want? By having the courage to follow their hearts these women will change lives for the better and the effects will be felt by the generations that follow. Meant to Be delivers an emotional, smart, funny and wise lesson about the importance of being true to yourself.",

Brendon Lowell loves love. It's why he created a dating app to help people find their one true pairing and why he's convinced \"the one\" is out there, even if he hasn't met her yet. Or... has he? When his sister's best friend turns up in Seattle unexpectedly, Brendon jumps at the chance to hang out with her. He's crushed on Annie since they were kids, and the stars have finally aligned, putting them in the same city at the same time. Annie booked a spur-of-the-moment trip to Seattle to spend time with friends before moving across the globe. She's not looking for love, especially with her best friend's brother. Annie remembers Brendon as a sweet, dorky kid. Except, the 6-foot-4 man who shows up at her door is a certified Hot Nerd and Annie... wants him? Oh yes. Getting involved would be a terrible idea--her stay is temporary and he wants forever--but when Brendon learns Annie has given up on dating, he's determined to prove that romance is real. Taking cues from his favorite rom-coms, Brendon plans to woo her with elaborate dates straight out of Nora Ephron's playbook. The clock is ticking on Annie's time in Seattle, and Brendon's starting to realize romance isn't just flowers and chocolate. But maybe real love doesn't need to be as perfect as the movies... as long as you think your partner hung the moon.",

Rather than comment only on individual plays, Frye treats the comedies as a group unified by recurrent structures, devices, and images: the storm at sea, the identical twins, the heroine disguised as a boy, the retreat into the forest, the heroine with a mysterious father.",

Their work as individuals, before and after coming together as Monty Python, demonstrates a restless curiosity about culture that embraces absurdity but seldom becomes cynical. Python members collectively and individually create unique approaches to theatre, film, video games, comic books, business training videos and more. Python Beyond Python increases our understanding of this often neglected work and the meanings of Monty Python.",

        title: "Ancient Scripts and Modern Experience on the English Stage, 1500-1700",
        description: "Unlike the contrast between the sacred and the taboo, the opposition of \"comic\" and \"tragic\" is not a way of categorizing experience that we find in cultures all over the world or even at different periods in Western civilization. Though medieval writers and readers distinguished stories with happy endings from stories with unhappy endings, it was not until the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries--fifteen hundred years after Sophocles, Euripides, Plautus, and Terence had last been performed in the theaters of the Roman Empire--that tragedy and comedy regained their ancient importance as ways of giving dramatic coherence to human events. Ancient Scripts and Modern Experience on the English Stage charts that rediscovery, not in the pages of scholars' books, but on the stages of England's schools, colleges, inns of court, and royal court, and finally in the public theaters of sixteenth-and seventeenth-century London. In bringing to imaginative life the scripts, eyewitness accounts, and financial records of these productions, Bruce Smith turns to the structuralist models that anthropologists have used to explain how human beings as social creatures organize and systematize experience. He sets in place the critical, physical, and social structures in which sixteenth-and seventeenth-century Englishmen watched productions of classical comedy and classical tragedy. Seen in these three contexts, these productions play out a conflict between classical and medieval ways of understanding and experiencing comedy's interplay between satiric and romantic impulses and tragedy's clash between individuals and society.

        title: "Don Quixote in England",
        description: "A significant reassessment of current assumptions about eighteenth-century literature and art. Seldom has a single book, much less a translation, so deeply affected English literature as the translation of Cervantes' Don Quixote in 1612. The comic novel inspired drawings, plays, sermons, and other translations, making the name of the Knight of la Mancha as familiar as any folk character in English lore. In this comprehensive study of the reception and conversion of Don Quixote in England, Ronald Paulson highlights the qualities of the novel that most attracted English imitators. The English Don Quixote was not the same knight who meandered through Spain, or found a place in other translations throughout Europe. The English Don Quixote found employment in all sorts of specifically English ways, not excluding the political uses to which a Spanish fool could be turned. According to Paulson, a major impact of the novel and its hero was their stimulation of discussion about comedy itself, what he calls the \"aesthetics of laughter.\" When Don Quixote reached England he did so at the time of the rise of empiricism, and adherents of both sides of the empiricist debate found arguments and evidence in the behavior and image of the noble knight. Four powerful disputes battered around his grey head: the proximity of madness and imagination; the definition of the beautiful; the cruelty of ridicule and its laughter; and the role of reason in the face of madness. Paulson's engaging account leads to a significant reassessment of current assumptions about eighteenth-century literature and art.",

It describes how the meanings of sacrifice change over time but never quite disappear. The book also explains why comedy but tragedy in particular decay and how some of their functions are taken over by reality TV and the blockbuster movie. The prime focus is on plays and how they reflect and respond to the great changes like the rise of Christianity, the Enlightenment and the coming of mass society. But a close study of these plays also reveals a number of continuities centred around sacrifice which illuminate aspects of human psychology and social organisation.",

Since then it has been adapted to other formats, slowly becoming an international multi-media phenomenon over a span of several years. The title The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is often abbreviated as \"HHG\", \"HHGG\", \"HHGTTG\", or \"H2G2\". The series is also often referred to as \"The Hitchhiker's Guide\", \"Hitchhiker's\", or simply \"[The] Guide.\" This title can refer to any of the various incarnations of the story, of which the books, having been translated into more than 30 languages by 2005. Although the various versions follow the same basic plot, they are in many places mutually contradictory, as Adams rewrote the story substantially for each new adaptation. In all versions, the series follows the adventures of Arthur Dent, a hapless Englishman who escapes the demolition of Earth by a bureaucratic alien race called the Vogons with his friend Ford Prefect, an alien from a small planet somewhere in the vicinity of Betelgeuse and researcher for the eponymous guidebook. Zaphod Beeblebrox, Ford's semi-cousin and part-time Galactic President, unknowingly saves the pair from certain death. He brings them aboard his stolen spaceship, the Heart of Gold, whose crew rounds out the main cast of characters: Marvin the Paranoid Android, a severely depressed robot, and Trillian, formerly known as Tricia McMillan, a woman Arthur once met at a party who he soon realises is the only other survivor of Earth's destruction. After this, the characters embark on a quest to find the legendary planet of Magrathea and the Question to the Ultimate Answer.",

        description: "InThe Comedians, comedy historian Kliph Nesteroff brings to life a century of American comedy with real-life characters, forgotten stars, mainstream heroes and counterculture iconoclasts. Based on over two hundred original interviews and extensive archival research, Nesteroff's groundbreaking work is a narrative exploration of the way comedians have reflected, shaped, and changed American culture over the past one hundred years. Starting with the vaudeville circuit at the turn of the last century, Nesteroff introduces the first stand-up comedian--an emcee who abandoned physical shtick for straight jokes. After the repeal of Prohibition, Mafia-run supper clubs replaced speakeasies, and mobsters replaced vaudeville impresarios as the comedian's primary employer. In the 1950s, the late-night talk show brought stand-up to a wide public, while Lenny Bruce, Mort Sahl, and Jonathan Winters attacked conformity andstaged a comedy rebellion in coffeehouses. From comedy's part in the Civil Rights movement and the social upheaval of the late 1960s, to the first comedy clubs of the 1970s and the cocaine-fueled comedy boom of the 1980s,The Comedians culminates with a new era of media-driven celebrity in the twenty-first century.",

Yet, according to William Eamon, it is in the \"how-to\" books written by medieval alchemists, magicians, and artisans that modern science has its roots. These compilations of recipes on everything from parlor tricks through medical remedies to wool-dyeing fascinated medieval intellectuals because they promised access to esoteric \"secrets of nature.\" In closely examining this rich but little-known source of literature, Eamon reveals that printing technology and popular culture had as great, if not stronger, an impact on early modern science as did the traditional academic disciplines.",

Prominent thinkers including Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, and Christopher Hitchens have published best-selling books denigrating religious belief. And these authors are merely the leading edge of a larger movement that includes much of the scientific community. In response, mathematician David Berlinski, himself a secular Jew, delivers a biting defense of religious thought. The Devil's Delusion is a brilliant, incisive, and funny book that explores the limits of science and the pretensions of those who insist it is the ultimate touchstone for understanding our world.",

How and why did books banned in Italy in the sixteenth century end up back on library shelves in the seventeenth? Historian Hannah Marcus uncovers how early modern physicians evaluated the utility of banned books and facilitated their continued circulation in conversation with Catholic authorities. Through extensive archival research, Marcus highlights how talk of scientific utility, once thought to have begun during the Scientific Revolution, in fact began earlier, emerging from ecclesiastical censorship and the desire to continue to use banned medical books. What\u2019s more, this censorship in medicine, which preceded the Copernican debate in astronomy by sixty years, has had a lasting impact on how we talk about new and controversial developments in scientific knowledge. Beautiful illustrations accompany this masterful, timely book about the interplay between efforts at intellectual control and the utility of knowledge.",

        title: "The Believing Brain",
        description: "The Believing Brain is bestselling author Michael Shermer's comprehensive and provocative theory on how beliefs are born, formed, reinforced, challenged, changed, and extinguished. In this work synthesizing thirty years of research, psychologist, historian of science, and the world's best-known skeptic Michael Shermer upends the traditional thinking about how humans form beliefs about the world. Simply put, beliefs come first and explanations for beliefs follow. The brain, Shermer argues, is a belief engine. From sensory data flowing in through the senses, the brain naturally begins to look for and find patterns, and then infuses those patterns with meaning. Our brains connect the dots of our world into meaningful patterns that explain why things happen, and these patterns become beliefs. Once beliefs are formed the brain begins to look for and find confirmatory evidence in support of those beliefs, which accelerates the process of reinforcing them, and round and round the process goes in a positive-feedback loop of belief confirmation. Shermer outlines the numerous cognitive tools our brains engage to reinforce our beliefs as truths. Interlaced with his theory of belief, Shermer provides countless real-world examples of how this process operates, from politics, economics, and religion to conspiracy theories, the supernatural, and the paranormal. Ultimately, he demonstrates why science is the best tool ever devised to determine whether or not a belief matches reality.",

        title: "The Age of Wonder",
        description: "Shortlisted for the BBC Samuel Johnson Prize for Non-Fiction and the Royal Society Prize for Science Books Richard Holmes, prize-winning biographer of Coleridge and Shelley, explores the scientific ferment that swept across Britain at the end of 18th century in this ground-breaking new biography . 'The Age of Wonder' is Richard Holmes's first major work of biography in over a decade. It has been inspired by the scientific ferment that swept through Britain at the end of the eighteenth century, 'The Age of Wonder' and which Holmes now radically redefines as 'the revolution of Romantic Science'. The book opens with Joseph Banks, botanist on Captain Cook's first Endeavour voyage, stepping onto a Tahitian beach in 1769, hoping to discover Paradise. Many other voyages of discovery swiftly follow, while Banks, now President of the Royal Society in London, becomes our narrative guide to what truly emerges as an Age of Wonder. Banks introduces us to the two scientific figures that dominate the book: astronomer William Herschel and chemist Humphry Davy. Herschel's tireless dedication to the stars, assisted (and perhaps rivalled) by his comet-finding sister Caroline, changed forever the public conception of the solar system, the Milky Way galaxy and the meaning of the universe itself. Davy first shocked the scientific community with his near-suicidal gas experiments in Bristol, then went on to save thousands of lives with his Safety Lamp and established British chemistry as the leading professional science in Europe. But at the cost, perhaps, of his own heart. Holmes proposes a radical vision of science before Darwin, exploring the earliest ideas of deep time and deep space, the creative rivalry with the French scientific establishment, and the startling impact of discovery on great writers and poets such as Mary Shelley, Coleridge, Byron and Keats. With his trademark sense of the human drama, he shows how great ideas and experiments are born out of lonely passion, how scientific discoveries (and errors) are made, how intense relationships are forged and broken by research, and how religious faith and scientific truth collide. The result is breathtaking in its originality, its story-telling energy, and not least, in its intellectual significance.",

        title: "The Real Anthony Fauci",
        description: "#1 on AMAZON, and a NEW YORK TIMES, WALL STREET JOURNAL, USA TODAY and PUBLISHERS WEEKLY NATIONAL BESTSELLER Pharma-funded mainstream media has convinced millions of Americans that Dr. Anthony Fauci is a hero. He is anything but. As director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), Dr. Anthony Fauci dispenses $6.1 billion in annual taxpayer-provided funding for scientific research, allowing him to dictate the subject, content, and outcome of scientific health research across the globe. Fauci uses the financial clout at his disposal to wield extraordinary influence over hospitals, universities, journals, and thousands of influential doctors and scientists\u2014whose careers and institutions he has the power to ruin, advance, or reward. During more than a year of painstaking and meticulous research, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. unearthed a shocking story that obliterates media spin on Dr. Fauci . . . and that will alarm every American\u2014Democrat or Republican\u2014who cares about democracy, our Constitution, and the future of our children\u2019s health. The Real Anthony Fauci reveals how \u201cAmerica\u2019s Doctor\u201d launched his career during the early AIDS crisis by partnering with pharmaceutical companies to sabotage safe and effective off-patent therapeutic treatments for AIDS. Fauci orchestrated fraudulent studies, and then pressured US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulators into approving a deadly chemotherapy treatment he had good reason to know was worthless against AIDS. Fauci repeatedly violated federal laws to allow his Pharma partners to use impoverished and dark-skinned children as lab rats in deadly experiments with toxic AIDS and cancer chemotherapies. In early 2000, Fauci shook hands with Bill Gates in the library of Gates\u2019 $147 million Seattle mansion, cementing a partnership that would aim to control an increasingly profitable $60 billion global vaccine enterprise with unlimited growth potential. Through funding leverage and carefully cultivated personal relationships with heads of state and leading media and social media institutions, the Pharma-Fauci-Gates alliance exercises dominion over global health policy. The Real Anthony Fauci details how Fauci, Gates, and their cohorts use their control of media outlets, scientific journals, key government and quasi-governmental agencies, global intelligence agencies, and influential scientists and physicians to flood the public with fearful propaganda about COVID-19 virulence and pathogenesis, and to muzzle debate and ruthlessly censor dissent.",

        description: "\"Throughout history, the religious imagination has attempted to control nothing so much as our bodies: what they are and what they mean; what we do with them, with whom, and under what circumstances; how they may be displayed-or, more commonly, how they must be hidden. Religious belief and mandate affect how our bodies are used in ritual practice, as well as how we use them to identify and marginalize threatening religious Others. This book examines how horror culture treats religious bodies that have stepped (or been pushed) out of their 'proper' place. Unlike most books on religion and horror, This book explores the dark spaces where sex, sexual representation, and the sexual body come together with religious belief and scary stories. Because these intersections of sex, horror, and the religious imagination force us to question the nature of consensus reality, supernatural horror, especially as it concerns the body, often shows us the religious imagination at work in real time. It is important to note that the discussion in this book is not limited either to horror cinema or to popular fiction, but considers a wide range of material, including literary horror, weird fiction, graphic storytelling, visual arts, participative culture, and aspects of real-world religious fear. It is less concerned with horror as a genre (which is mainly a function of marketing) and more with the horror mode, a way of storytelling that finds expression across a number of genres, a variety of media, and even blurs the boundary between fiction and non-fiction. This expanded focus not only deepens the pool of potential examples, but invites a much broader readership in for a swim\"--",

In this volume, horror master Scott Cawthon spins three sinister novella-length stories from different corners of his series' canon. Each story comes complete with accompanying artwork from fan-favorite game artist LadyFiszi, who brings the horror to life in startling new ways.

        title: "Religion of Fear",
        description: "Conservative evangelicalism has transformed American politics, disseminating a sometimes fearful message not just through conventional channels, but through subcultures and alternate modes of communication. Within this world is a \"Religion of Fear,\" a critical impulse that dramatizes cultural and political conflicts and issues in frightening ways that serve to contrast \"orthodox\" behaviors and beliefs with those linked to darkness, fear, and demonology. Jason Bivins offers close examinations of several popular evangelical cultural creations including the Left Behind novels, church-sponsored Halloween \"Hell Houses,\" sensational comic books, especially those disseminated by Jack Chick, and anti-rock and -rap rhetoric and censorship. Bivins depicts these fascinating and often troubling phenomena in vivid (sometimes lurid) detail and shows how they seek to shape evangelical cultural identity. As the \"Religion of Fear\" has developed since the 1960s, Bivins sees its message moving from a place of relative marginality to one of prominence. What does it say about American public life that such ideas of fearful religion and violent politics have become normalized? Addressing this question, Bivins establishes links and resonances between the cultural politics of evangelical pop, the activism of the New Christian Right, and the political exhaustion facing American democracy. Religion of Fear is a significant contribution to our understanding of the new shapes of political religion in the United States, of American evangelicalism, of the relation of religion and the media, and the link between religious pop culture and politics.",

She'd just stumbled in front of his car. Now he simply wanted to forget the whole messy business. Later, when the scales told him he was losing weight, it was what the doctor ordered. His wife was pleased - as she should have been. But . . . 'Thinner' - the word, the old man's curse, has lodged in Billy's mind like a fattening worm, eating at his flesh, at his reason.

These buildings reimagine the possibilities of architectural language, shifting from natural norms to other, more rarefied and exciting options. They define an expanded aesthetic field that marries the beautiful to the distorted, the awkward, the manifold, and the indeterminate. Through an investigation that spans architecture, art, and literature, this study limns horror through its shifting forms and identifies a creeping unease that lingers at the very center of the modern project.",

In this book, MacIntyre sought to address a crisis in moral language that he traced back to a European Enlightenment that had made the formulation of moral principles increasingly difficult. In the search for a way out of this impasse, MacIntyre returns to an earlier strand of ethical thinking, that of Aristotle, who emphasised the importance of 'virtue' to the ethical life. More than thirty years after its original publication, After Virtue remains a work that is impossible to ignore for anyone interested in our understanding of ethics and morality today.",

In The Construction of Social Reality, eminent philosopher John Searle examines the structure of social reality (or those portions of the world that are facts only by human agreement, such as money, marriage, property, and government), and contrasts it to a brute reality that is independent of human agreement. Searle shows that brute reality provides the indisputable foundation for all social reality, and that social reality, while very real, is maintained by nothing more than custom and habit.",

        title: "Escalas de justicia",
        description: "Hasta hace poco, las luchas por la justicia ten\u00edan lugar con el trasfondo de un marco que se daba por supuesto: el Estado territorialmente delimitado. Con esta imagen \"westfaliana\" del espacio pol\u00edtico asumida por defecto, apenas se discut\u00eda sobre el alcance de la justicia. En la actualidad, activistas de los derechos humanos y feministas internacionales rechazan el punto de vista de que la justicia es s\u00f3lo una relaci\u00f3n dom\u00e9stica entre ciudadanos de un mismo pa\u00eds. Oponi\u00e9ndose a las injusticias que traspasan fronteras, hacen de la escala de la justicia una cuesti\u00f3n de lucha expl\u00edcita. Nancy Fraser se pregunta: \u00bfcu\u00e1l es el marco adecuado para teorizar sobre la justicia y cu\u00e1l es la escala realmente justa? La autora revisa sus conocidas teor\u00edas de la redistribuci\u00f3n y el reconocimiento, e introduce la \"representaci\u00f3n\" como una tercera dimensi\u00f3n \"pol\u00edtica\" de la justicia, elaborando un nuevo tipo reflexivo de teor\u00eda cr\u00edtica que sit\u00faa en primer plano la injusticia de una atribuci\u00f3n de marco injusta. Dialogando y debatiendo con pensadores como Habermas, Rawls, Foucault o Arendt, contempla un espacio pol\u00edtico poswestfaliano que abraza la solidaridad transnacional, una esfera p\u00fablica transfronteriza, el establecimiento de marcos democr\u00e1ticos y proyectos emancipatorios transfronterizos. El resultado es una s\u00f3lida reflexi\u00f3n sobre qui\u00e9n cuenta respecto a qu\u00e9, en el terreno de la justicia, en un mundo en globalizaci\u00f3n.",

Al idealismo de Plat\u00f3n, de los Padres de la Iglesia y de Kant se opone otra l\u00ednea que no ve el cuerpo y el placer como un obst\u00e1culo para el conocimiento, sino todo lo contrario. En el primer cap\u00edtulo, el fil\u00f3sofo se presenta en carne viva: \u00abFallec\u00ed a la edad de diez a\u00f1os...\u00bb Es el momento en que ingresa en el orfanato.

        description: "This volume is a collection of essays by various contributors in honor of the late Laurence Berns, Richard Hammond Elliot Tutor Emeritus at St. John's College, Annapolis. The essays address the literary, political, theological, and philosophical themes of his life's work as a scholar, teacher, and constant companion of the \"great books.\" Included are essays interpreting biblical books, as well as books by Homer, Herodotus, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Plato, Virgil, Dante, Spinoza, Milton, Rousseau, Darwin, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Camus, and H.G. Wells. Like their honoree, the essayists aim at understanding such books as their authors wished them to be understood for the light they shed on universal and timeless questions about God, nature, and human life which animated the authors themselves and which they saw fit to share, elegantly and eloquently, with thoughtful readers. Each essay is, in its way, a model of how to read and reflect on the writings of the great authors.\"",

        title: "Commentary on Hebrews",
        description: "The Biblical Theology for Christian Proclamation Commentary series explores the theology of the Bible in considerable depth, spanning both Testaments. Authors come from a variety of backgrounds and perspectives, though all affirm the inerrancy and inspiration of Scripture. United in their high view of Scripture, and in their belief in the underlying unity of Scripture, which is ultimately grounded in the unity of God himself, each author explores the contribution of a given book or group of books to the theology of Scripture as a whole. While conceived as stand-alone volumes, each volume thus also makes a contribution to the larger whole. All volumes provide a discussion of introductory matters, including the historical setting and the literary structure of a given book of Scripture. Also included is an exegetical treatment of all the relevant passages in succinct commentary-style format. The biblical theology approach of the series will also inform and play a role in the commentary proper. The commentator permits a discussion between the commentary proper and the biblical theology that it reflects by a series of cross-references. The major contribution of each volume, however, is a thorough discussion of the most important themes of the biblical book in relation to the canon as a whole. This format allows each contributor to ground Biblical Theology, as is proper, in an appropriate appraisal of the relevant historical and literary features of a particular book in Scripture while at the same time focusing on its major theological contribution to the entire Christian canon in the context of the larger salvation-historical metanarrative of Scripture. Within this overall format, there will be room for each individual contributor to explore the major themes of his or her particular corpus in the way he or she sees most appropriate for the material under consideration. This format, in itself, would already be a valuable contribution to Biblical Theology. But there are other series that try to accomplish a survey of the Bible's theology as well. What distinguishes the present series is its orientation toward Christian proclamation. This is the Biblical Theologyfor Christian Proclamation commentary series! As a result, the ultimate purpose of this set of volumes is not exclusively, or even primarily, academic. Rather, we seek to relate Biblical Theology to our own lives and to the life of the church. Our desire is to equip those in Christian ministry who are called by God to preach and teach the precious truths of Scripture to their congregations, both in North America and in a global context. It is our hope and our prayer that the 40 volumes of this series, once completed, will bear witness to the unity in diversity of the canon of Scripture as they probe the individual contributions of each of its 66 books. The authors and editors are united in their desire that in so doing the series will magnify the name of Christ and bring glory to the triune God who revealed himself in Scripture so that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved\u2014to the glory of God the Father and his Son, the Lord Jesus Christ, under the illumination of the Holy Spirit, and for the good of his church. To God alone be the glory: soli Deo gloria. In his volume on Hebrews, Thomas R. Schreiner says, \"The words of Jesus on the cross, 'it is finished' (John 19:30) capture the theology of Hebrews. \"My aim in this commentary is to focus on the biblical theology of the letter. The emphasis on biblical theology shows up especially in the introduction and conclusion where theological structures and themes are considered. In the introduction I will examine four different structures that are woven into the entire letter: 1) promise/fulfillment; 2) eschatology; 3) typology; and 4) spatial orientation (which can also be described as the relationship between heaven and earth i",

        description: "Whether you're a lifelong believer, a devout atheist, or someone who remains uncertain about the role of religion in our lives, this insightful manifesto will engage you with its provocative ideas. With a close and studied reading of the major religious texts, Christopher Hitchens documents the ways in which religion is a man-made wish, a cause of dangerous sexual repression, and a distortion of our origins in the cosmos. With eloquent clarity, Hitchens frames the argument for a more secular life based on science and reason, in which hell is replaced by the Hubble Telescope's awesome view of the universe, and Moses and the burning bush give way to the beauty and symmetry of the double helix. In the tradition of Bertrand Russell's Why I Am Not a Christian and Sam Harris's The End of Faith, Christopher Hitchens makes the ultimate case against religion.",

This authoritative biography ranges across the whole of Adorno\u2032s life and career, from his childhood and student years to his years in emigration in the United States and his return to postwar Germany. At the same time, Muller\u2013Doohm examines the full range of Adorno\u2032s writings on philosophy, sociology, literary theory, music theory and cultural criticism. Drawing on an array of sources from Adorno\u2032s personal correspondence with Horkheimer, Benjamin, Berg, Marcuse, Kracauer and Mann to interviews, notes and both published and unpublished writings, Muller\u2013Doohm situates Adorno\u2032s contributions in the context of his times and provides a rich and balanced appraisal of his significance in the 20th Century as a whole. Muller\u2013Doohm\u2032s clear prose succeeds in making accessible some of the most complex areas of Adorno\u2032s thought. This outstanding biography will be the standard work on Adorno for years to come.",

        title: "What Is Marriage?",
        description: "Until just yesterday, no society--monogamous or polygamous\u2014had defined marriage as anything other than a male-female union. With clear and cogent arguments, What Is Marriage? explains the rational basis of this historic consensus. It defeats the arguments for recognizing same-sex partnerships as marriages and shows how doing so would harm the common good. Originally published in the Harvard Journal of Law and Public Policy, this book\u2019s core argument quickly became the year\u2019s most widely read essay of more than 300,000 scholarly articles posted on the Social Sciences Research Network. Now expanded to address a flurry of prominent responses, What Is Marriage? stands poised to meet its moment as few books of this generation have. If the marriage debate in America is decided in the next few years, it will be either with this book\u2019s help, or despite its powerful arguments. Rhodes Scholar Sherif Girgis, Princeton University professor Robert P. George, and Ryan T. Anderson, editor of the online journal Public Discourse, provide a devastating critique of the claim that equality requires redefining marriage. They point out that any assessment of what \u201cmarriage equality\u201d demands depends on first determining what marriage is\u2014what sort of relationships must be treated as essentially the same. They defend the principle that marriage, as a comprehensive union ordered to family life, requires a man and a woman. And they argue for the great social benefits of enshrining this principle in law. Most compellingly, they show that those who embrace same-sex civil marriage leave themselves no firm ground\u2014none\u2014for not recognizing as marriages every relationship type describable in polite English, including multiple-partner (\u201cpolyamorous\u201d) sexual unions. Finally, What Is Marriage? decisively answer common objections: that the historic view is rooted in bigotry (like laws forbidding interracial marriage); that it is callous to people\u2019s needs; that it can\u2019t show the harm of recognizing same-sex couplings, or the point of recognizing infertile ones; and that it treats a mere \u201csocial construct\u201d as if it were natural, or an unreasoned religious view as if it were rational.",

        title: "The Formation and Transmission of Western Legal Culture",
        description: "This volume surveys 150 law books of fundamental importance in the history of Western legal literature and culture. The entries are organized in three sections: the first dealing with the transitional period of fifteenth-century editions of medieval authorities, the second spanning the early modern period from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, and the third focusing on the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. The contributors are scholars from all over the world. Each \u2018old book\u2019 is analyzed by a recognized specialist in the specific field of interest. Individual entries give a short biography of the author and discuss the significance of the works in the time and setting of their publication, and in their broader influence on the development of law worldwide. Introductory essays explore the development of Western legal traditions, especially the influence of the English common law, and of Roman and canon law on legal writers, and the borrowings and interaction between them. The book goes beyond the study of institutions and traditions of individual countries to chart a broader perspective on the transmission of legal concepts across legal, political, and geographical boundaries. Examining the branches of this genealogical tree of books makes clear their pervasive influence on modern legal systems, including attempts at rationalizing custom or creating new hybrid systems by transplanting Western legal concepts into other jurisdictions.",

Prominent thinkers including Richard Dawkins, Sam Harris, Daniel Dennett, and Christopher Hitchens have published best-selling books denigrating religious belief. And these authors are merely the leading edge of a larger movement that includes much of the scientific community. In response, mathematician David Berlinski, himself a secular Jew, delivers a biting defense of religious thought. The Devil's Delusion is a brilliant, incisive, and funny book that explores the limits of science and the pretensions of those who insist it is the ultimate touchstone for understanding our world.",

This book evaluates the cultural status and importance of these polyvalent, ambiguous artefacts which embody many of the dualities and paradoxes inherent in the racial and religious dilemmas of Early Modern Spain. Using the words of key individuals, and set against the background of conflict between Spanish Christians and Moriscos in the late fifteen-hundreds, The Lead Books of Granada tells a story of resilient resistance and creative ingenuity in the face of impossibly powerful negative forces, a resistance embodied by a small group of courageous, idealistic men who lived a double life in Granada just before the expulsion of the Moriscos.",

It not only surveys one of the most important areas of modern thought; it also shows the confusion that arises from imperfect understanding of the uses of language. A first-rate antidote for fuzzy thought and muddled writing, this remarkable book has helped philosophers, writers, speakers, teachers, students, and general readers alike. Mr. Ayers sets up specific tests by which you can easily evaluate statements of ideas. You will also learn how to distinguish ideas that cannot be verified by experience \u2014 those expressing religious, moral, or aesthetic experience, those expounding theological or metaphysical doctrine, and those dealing with a priori truth. The basic thesis of this work is that philosophy should not squander its energies upon the unknowable, but should perform its proper function in criticism and analysis.",

        title: "The Metaphysical Club",
        description: "The Metaphysical Club is the winner of the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for History. A riveting, original book about the creation of modern American thought. The Metaphysical Club was an informal group that met in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1872, to talk about ideas. Its members included Oliver Well Holmes, Jr., future associate justice of the United States Supreme Court; William James, the father of modern American psychology; and Charles Sanders Peirce, logician, scientist, and the founder of semiotics. The Club was probably in existence for about nine months. No records were kept. The one thing we know that came out of it was an idea -- an idea about ideas. This book is the story of that idea. Holmes, James, and Peirce all believed that ideas are not things \"out there\" waiting to be discovered but are tools people invent -- like knives and forks and microchips -- to make their way in the world. They thought that ideas are produced not by individuals, but by groups of individuals -- that ideas are social. They do not develop according to some inner logic of their own but are entirely depent -- like germs -- on their human carriers and environment. And they thought that the survival of any idea deps not on its immutability but on its adaptability. The Metaphysical Club is written in the spirit of this idea about ideas. It is not a history of philosophy but an absorbing narrative about personalities and social history, a story about America. It begins with the Civil War and s in 1919 with Justice Holmes's dissenting opinion in the case of U.S. v. Abrams-the basis for the constitutional law of free speech. The first four sections of the book focus on Holmes, James, Peirce, and their intellectual heir, John Dewey. The last section discusses some of the fundamental twentieth-century ideas they are associated with. This is a book about a way of thinking that changed American life.",

Together these women have a shared story to tell, as they blaze a trail across some of the most dramatic events of the last century \u2013 revolution, totalitarianism, the American dream. Enraged by injustice, they are each in touch with what is most painful about being human, bound together by their willingness to bring the unspeakable to light. Taking the argument into the present are today's women, courageous individuals involved in some of the cruellest realities of our times. Grappling with the reality of honour killing \u2013 notably through the stories of Shafilea Ahmed, Fadime Sahindal and Heshu Yones \u2013 Rose argues that the work of feminism is far from done. In the final three chapters, she celebrates the work of three brilliant contemporary artists \u2013 Esther Shalev-Gerz, Yael Bartana and Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Oulton \u2013 whose work grows out of an unflinching engagement with all that is darkest in the modern world. Women in Dark Times shows us how these visionary women offer a new template for feminism. Taking their stand against the iniquities of our times, they tread a path between public and private pain, confronting us with what we need most urgently, but also often, cannot bear to see.",

        description: "Excerpt from Exact Philosophy: Books First and Second The first indisposition of the general or national mind which a philosophical writer has to anticipate and provide against is, an indisposition towards the reading even, to say nothing of the study, of philosophic truth, whatever may be its degree of practical value. To the ordinary thinker this kind of knowledge presents nothing that will immediately excite ordinary pleasurable sensation; he perceives that the study of it would be irksome; and he evades the trouble that the study of it would cost him by the self-flattering, lying plea of its inutility. To him whose cranium is becoming the case of hardened forms of spurious knowledge, that philosophic truth which is indispensable to the formation even of the loftiest order of human intelligence, is to him, the ordinary thinker, unnecessary. In vain you verify for him by means of his daily experience, as a caution-light, the Greek thesis - \"God gives nothing without labour.\" \"The sluggard,\" says the royal Hebrew philosopher, \"is wiser \"in his own conceit than seven men that can render \"a reason.\" About the Publisher Forgotten Books publishes hundreds of thousands of rare and classic books.

We are connected all the time. How do we find out who we are in this digital era? Where do we create the space to explore our identity? How can we come together in solidarity? A glitch is normally thought of as an error, a faulty overlaying, but, as Legacy Russell shows, liberation can be found within the fissures between gender, technology, and the body. The glitch offers an opportunity for us to perform and transform ourselves in an infinite variety of identities. In Glitch Feminism, Russell makes a series of radical demands through memoir, art, and critical theory, as well as the work of contemporary artists\u2014including Juliana Huxtable, Sondra Perry, boychild, Victoria Sin, and Kia LaBeija\u2014who have travelled through the glitch in their work. Timely and provocative, Glitch Feminism shows how error can lead to revolution.",

        title: "Object-Oriented Ontology",
        description: "What is reality, really? Are humans more special or important than the non-human objects we perceive? How does this change the way we understand the world? We humans tend to believe that things are only real in as much as we perceive them, an idea reinforced by modern philosophy, which privileges us as special, radically different in kind from all other objects. But as Graham Harman, one of the theory's leading exponents, shows, Object-Oriented Ontology rejects the idea of human specialness: the world, he states, is clearly not the world as manifest to humans. At the heart of this philosophy is the idea that objects - whether real, fictional, natural, artificial, human or non-human - are mutually autonomous. In this brilliant new introduction, Graham Harman lays out the history, ideas and impact of Object-Oriented Ontology, taking in everything from art and literature, politics and natural science along the way. Graham Harman is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at SCI-Arc, Los Angeles. A key figure in the contemporary speculative realism movement in philosophy and for his development of the field of object-oriented ontology, he was named by Art Review magazine as one of the 100 most influential figures in international art.",

        description: "This volume brings the first English translation of the Confucian classics, Four Books for Women, to the English-speaking world with extensive commentary by the compiler, Wang Xiang, and annotations by the translator. Written by women for women's education, the Confucian Four Books for Womenspanned the 1st to the 16th centuries, and encompassed Ban Zhao's Lessons for Women, Song Ruoxin's and Song Ruozhao's Analects for Women, Empress Renxiaowen's Teachings for the Inner Court, and Madame Liu's (Chaste Widow Wang's) Short Records of Models for Women. As a female counterpart to the famous Sishu (Four Books) compiled by Zhu Xi, Wang Xiang's Nu sishu was an indispensable primer for women's education from its publication in the 16th century until the beginning of the 20th century. This work provides an invaluable look at the long-standing historyand evolution of Chinese women's writing, education, identity, and philosophical discourse, along with their struggles and triumphs, across the millenniums and numerous Chinese dynasties. This volume also comes with a substantial main introduction, additional introductions preceding each of the fourbooks, and other helpful resources to acclimate the reader to the historical and cultural background in which each book is situated, to illustrate why these women wrote and how they empower women, and to bring the women to life as real, living people.",

        description: "Althusser dissects the leading Enlightenment philosopher Althusser delivered these lectures on Rousseau's Discourse on the Origins of Inequality at the \u00c9cole normale sup\u00e9rieure in Paris in 1972. They are fascinating for two reasons. First, they gave rise to a new generation of Rousseau scholars, attentive not just to Rousseau's ideas, but also to those of his concepts that were buried beneath metaphors or fictional situations and characters. A new way of coming to terms with Rousseau's theoretical rigour, beneath his apparent reveries and sentimental flights of fancy, was here put to work. Second, we are now discovering that the 'late Althusser's' theses about aleatory materialism and the need to break with the strict determinism of theories of history in order to devise a new philosophy 'for Marx' were being worked out well before 1985 - in this reading of Rousseau dating from twelve years earlier, which introduces into Rousseau's text the ideas of the void, the accident, the take, and the necessity of contingency.",

Take another brilliantly twisted adventure with Sam, Jared, and little miss dung daks smelly melly poop pants as they head off on holiday to the most dangerous place on the planet. But, is it really a holiday or a final resting place to get rid of annoying kids? With the poisonous puke plants, ferocious farting animals, tree swinging hippies, and Smelly Melly's deadliest fungus growing, chunky chuck-up nappies yet. This time, adventure is snapping at their heels, and they just might not be able to keep their stomachs' contents down.",

From Neighbours to Stock Aitken and Waterman to her disco revival at the top of the charts, this intimate biography, applauded by Kylie's manager for its accuracy, explores the real woman behind the public image. Drawn from interviews with key players in the industry, Kylie, friends and colleagues, Kylie Naked was the first book to delve into the real Kylie, from her success as a soap star to her assault on the UK charts, and to this day is still regarded as the most authorative and in-depth portait of one of pop music's most private stars.",

        title: "Arranging for the Piano",
        description: "ARRANGING FOR THE PIANO by Dr. Cesar de la Cerda is an excellent resource for piano players (professionals or students), composers, and piano arrangers that want to be more creative in the piano. The book will show the procedures of structural resources that allow the ability to convert a melody and its chords into a piano composition, regardless of the genre. The elements necessary as a starting point for the creation of an arrangement are simple. They only consist of one pure melody line, a set of chords accompanying it, and a time signature or conventional time measure, simply put melody, harmony, and rhythm. Based on an original theme whose notation means are only a melody on the treble clef, chord symbols, and a fraction indicating the rhythm, the arranger goes on to its transformation into a free piano piece or composition. The resources used to this end are the arrangement techniques whose detailed description is the main content of this book. Every arranger or composer needs to constantly perfect the execution skills, increase and renew his or her expression resources and develop his or her fantasy and creativity so that a personal style evolves. With these piano techniques, you will be able to achieve the main tasks: transforming a simple melody and few chords into a piano composition. The Chapters of this book follow a gradual development. We start going from relatively simple techniques to others of greater complexity. However, the student should feel free to proceed and choose selectively the training sequence regarding the techniques without having to follow one predetermined order. All the composition procedures explained in the book, even though they can be combined in different ways in practice, are independent of each other and can be studied in isolated form. Every technique is followed by practical exercises. Their objective is to perfect technical performance. Such exercises will make it possible for the student to reach in a relatively short period of time Their objective is to perfect the technical performance. Such exercises will make it possible for the student to reach in a relatively short period of time, the understanding and efficient command of the set of techniques included in \u201cArranging for the Piano\u201d. The method uses the Juilliard School of the music system. To know more about it visit: www.moderntonalharmony.com Facebook/moderntonalharmony Youtube.com/playcreativepiano",

        description: "In Italy during the late cinquecento, printed music could be found not only in the homes of the wealthy or the music professional, but also in lay homes, courts, and academies. No longer confined to the salons of the elite, music took on the role of social play and recreation. Paul Schleuse examines these new musical forms through a study of the music books of Italian priest, poet, and composer, Orazio Vecchi. Composed for minor patrons and the wider music-buying public, Vecchi's madrigals took as their subjects game-playing, drinking, hunting, battles, and the life of the street. Schleuse looks at how music and game-playing allowed singers and performers to play the roles of exemplary pastoral characters and also comic, foreign, and \"rustic\" others in ways that defined and ultimately reinforced social norms of the times. His findings reposition Orazio Vecchi as one of the most innovative composers of the late 16th century.",

A brainy, irresistible adventure, How Music Works is an impassioned argument about music's liberating, life-affirming power.",

        title: "Listen",
        description: "An enlightening exploration of the concept of listening and the evolving role of the listener from Beethoven to Charlie Parker to contemporary remixing. In this intimate meditation on listening, Peter Szendy examines what the role of the listener is, and has been, through the centuries. The roles of the composer and the musician are clear, but where exactly does the listener stand in relation to music? What is the responsibility of the listener? Does a listener have any rights, as the author and composer have copyright? Is it possible to convey to others how we ourselves listen to music? Though personal memory and intellectual history, Szendy takes readers on a fascinating and ear-opening journey to answer these questions. Along the way, he examines the evolution of copyright laws as applied to musical works and takes us into the courtroom to examine different debates on what we are and aren\u2019t allowed to listen to, and to witness the fine line between musical borrowing and outright plagiarism. Finally, he examines the recent phenomenon of DJs and digital compilations, and wonders how technology has affected our listening habits.",

        title: "Franz Liszt: The Weimar years, 1848-1861",
        description: "The final volume of Walker's monumental study (Franz Liszt, Vol. 1: The Virtuoso Years, 1811-47, Franz Liszt, Vol. 2: The Weimar Years, 1848-61,) draws upon some recent scholarship to present a more complete picture of Liszt's life and achievements than had been previously possible. Liszt's remarkably peripatetic existence creates manifold challenges for the conscientious scholar, but Walker is more than equal to the task. His narrative is copiously footnoted yet never seems to bog down in minutiae. In fact, quite the opposite: the prose is so lively that the reader is often swept along by the narrative. A particularly fascinating section concerns the infamous Cosima Liszt-Hans von Buelow-Richard Wagner triangle, which is skillfully dissected by Walker to separate legend from accurate history. Liszt emerges as an unmistakably generous and self-effacing man in his later years whose prodigious gifts as a composer and pianist were undimmed until the very end. Walker provides frequent musical examples throughout, and his comments on them are not too technical for the general reader. This three-part work, which represents a 25-year labor of love, is now the definitive work on Liszt in English and belongs in all music collections. - from Library Journal.",

        description: "Mastering Fundamentals in a Musical Context Fundamentals of Music provides a clear and comprehensive approach to mastering the language of music. The authors invite students to create composition projects, develop aural skills through listening exercises, and analyze musical examples from various styles and genres. With two new authors, this text has been thoroughly revised and expanded, yet maintains the intent of its original author Earl Henry. The optional MySearchLab with eText powered by Exposition Music provides opportunities for students to practice their skills and receive immediate feedback. Each chapter has a pretest, post-test, and chapter review. Separate drills are included for ear training. These assessments feature more than the usual multiple-choice questions, allowing a student to drag and drop notation on a musical staff. This provides opportunities to demonstrate the mastery of concepts and reach a variety of learning styles. A better teaching and learning experience This program will provide a better teaching and learning experience-- for you and your students. Here's how: Personalize Learning -- The new MySearchLab with eText delivers proven results in helping students succeed, provides engaging experiences that personalize learning, and comes from a trusted partner with educational expertise and a deep commitment to helping students and instructors achieve their goals. Improve Critical Thinking -- Each of the 13 chapters divide into five main areas allowing students to learn terms and symbols and expand their listening skills. Exercises encourage students to apply concepts to a piece of music at the conclusion of each chapter. Engage Students -- Each chapter concludes with a number of creative exercises and projects allowing students to learn interactively. With the audio CD and MySearchLab powered by Exposition Music, students can polish their aural skills using the drills designed specifically to accompany the text. Support Instructors -- A full Instructor's Manual is available for this text. Additional assessment is made available through Exposition Music. This Books a la Carte Edition is an unbound, three-holed punched, loose-leaf version of the textbook and provides students the opportunity to personalize their book by incorporating their own notes and taking only the portion of the book they need to class - all at a fraction of the bound book price.",
